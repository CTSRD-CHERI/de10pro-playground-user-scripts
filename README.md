# DE10 playground user scripts

This repository provides various scripts to use the University of Cambridge DE10 playground.
Several shared machines provide DE10 boards which can be accessed by users through a dedicated VM instance.
The scripts in this repository help to produce VM images and payloads to run interactively or non-interactively in a VM with access to a DE10.
